## ⚖️ Pre-Implementation Challenges

List the major risks or concerns the project faced before adopting TBL practices.

| Challenge | Description | TBL Dimension |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
|  |  | People / Planet / Profit |

> _Tip:_ Include human, environmental, and economic tensions — e.g., “energy consumption,” “workforce impact,” or “short-term ROI focus.”

---

## 🧩 Initial TBL Scorecard

Provide a baseline assessment before interventions.

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| People |  |  |  |  |
| Planet |  |  |  |  |
| Profit |  |  |  |  |

> _Interpretation:_  
> -2 = Harmful impact, 0 = Neutral, +2 = Strongly positive.

## 🌍 TBL-Driven Interventions

Describe what was done to improve the People, Planet, or Profit dimensions.

| Intervention | Dimension | Impact | Effort | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------|------------|
|  |  |  |  |  |

> _Tip:_ Include both process and technology actions (e.g., “adopted green compute regions,” “added human-in-loop review,” etc.)

## 📈 Updated TBL Scorecard (Post-Intervention)

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Change |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| People |  |  |  | ▲ |
| Planet |  |  |  | ▲ |
| Profit |  |  |  | ▲ |

**Composite Score:**  
Summarize whether the project moved toward a more sustainable balance.
