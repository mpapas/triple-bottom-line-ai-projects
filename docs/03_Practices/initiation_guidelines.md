# Initiation Phase Guidelines

### 🎯 Purpose
Establish a shared understanding of why the AI project exists and how it will create value for **People, Planet, and Profit**.  
This phase sets the ethical, social, and sustainability intent that guides every subsequent decision.

### ⚙️ Key TBL & Responsible AI Actions
| Focus Area | Action | Example |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Purpose Definition** | Expand the business case to include social and environmental objectives. | "This model reduces carbon-intensive manual reviews by 30% while maintaining fair outcomes." |
| **Stakeholder Mapping** | Identify stakeholders representing people, sustainability, and ethics perspectives. | Include Legal, HR, DEI, and Environmental teams early. |
| **Ethical Impact Framing** | Conduct a high-level *Ethical Impact Canvas* session. | Ask: Who benefits? Who could be harmed? |
| **Baseline Metrics** | Define baseline KPIs for each TBL dimension. | People: employee engagement; Planet: energy baseline; Profit: OPEX reduction target. |
