## üß© Applying This in Projects

1. **Map project goals** ‚Üí Identify where People, Planet, and Profit intersect.  
   *Example: A cloud migration affects employee workload (People), data center energy (Planet), and cost savings (Profit).*
2. **Select metrics** from standards above that match project outcomes.  
3. **Set baselines** early and measure deltas (improvement over time).  
4. **Use AI or automation tools** (like your TBL Assessment GPT) to track, normalize, and report values.  
5. **Communicate trade-offs** transparently ‚Äî a 2-week schedule extension may reduce burnout *and* air freight emissions while slightly increasing cost.  
6. **Report with credibility** ‚Äî cite GRI, ISO, or PMI sources in your documentation for auditability.
