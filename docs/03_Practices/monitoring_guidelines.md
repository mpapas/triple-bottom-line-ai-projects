| **Anomaly Response** | Define thresholds for bias, drift, or energy overuse alerts. | Automatically flag >10% deviation in bias scores. |
| **Stakeholder Transparency** | Communicate TBL results in Steering Committees. | “Fairness drift corrected after retraining.” |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Align with evolving AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act). | Maintain documentation for audit readiness. |
