### ⚙️ Key TBL & Responsible AI Actions
| Focus Area | Action | Example |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Fairness & Bias Testing** | Integrate fairness audits into sprints. | Use Azure Responsible AI Dashboard or AIF360. |
| **Explainability & Transparency** | Require documentation for every model decision point. | Implement Model Cards and Decision Logs. |
| **Energy & Compute Monitoring** | Track compute cost and emissions per training run. | Log GPU hours or carbon intensity (gCO₂e). |
| **Accessibility & UX** | Include inclusive design in user testing. | Screen readers, language localization, tone sensitivity. |
| **Change Control** | Include RAI/TBL checkpoints in change review boards. | Evaluate each new feature for ethical and environmental impact. |
