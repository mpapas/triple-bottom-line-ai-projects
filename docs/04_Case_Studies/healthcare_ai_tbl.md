# Case Study: Responsible AI in Healthcare Diagnostics

**Project Title:** AI-Assisted Diagnostic Imaging Platform  
**Duration:** 12 months  
**Objective:** Deploy a clinical AI system to assist radiologists in detecting early-stage anomalies in chest X-rays, reducing diagnostic turnaround time by 40% without compromising patient safety or privacy.

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

A regional hospital network partnered with a medical technology vendor to implement an AI-powered imaging assistant.  
The solution analyzed scans for potential findings and presented prioritized results to radiologists within existing workflows.

**Stakeholders:**  
- Chief Medical Officer (Sponsor)  
- Radiology Department (120 clinicians)  
- IT & Compliance Teams  
- AI Vendor (FDA-cleared software partner)  

**Constraints:**  
- HIPAA and GDPR compliance required.  
- Model updates subject to clinical validation.  
- Must maintain 95% diagnostic accuracy parity with human baseline.

## 🧮 Key Insights for Project Managers

1. **Regulation ≠ Restriction.**  
   HIPAA and FDA processes, though rigorous, can strengthen AI safety and trust.

2. **Clinician involvement is the make-or-break factor.**  
   Early co-design sessions accelerated adoption and reduced post-launch resistance.

3. **Energy efficiency belongs in clinical IT.**  
   Distillation and scheduling of inference workloads saved ~35% power use.

4. **Responsible AI is measurable.**  
   Tracking safety, carbon, and adoption together gives a true TBL view.

## 📊 Lessons Learned

| Phase | Lesson | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Initiation | Clinical trust must be designed, not assumed. | Co-create with practitioners from day one. |
| Planning | Privacy-by-design adds credibility. | Include privacy specialists in design workshops. |
| Execution | Efficiency is a form of ethics. | Optimize for compute and latency equally. |
| Monitoring | Continuous validation prevents model drift harm. | Recalibrate models quarterly with clinician feedback. |
| Closure | Publish Responsible AI outcomes transparently. | Share anonymized results to promote public confidence. |
