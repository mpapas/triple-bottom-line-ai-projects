# 📚 Triple Bottom Line Case Studies Summary

The following case studies illustrate how Project Managers can apply the **Triple Bottom Line (TBL)** and **Responsible AI (RAI)** principles across different industries and project types.  
Each example shows how *People, Planet, and Profit* outcomes can be balanced through thoughtful interventions — proving that responsible innovation is measurable and repeatable.

## 🌍 Cross-Case Insights

### 1. **People**
Across all projects, early stakeholder engagement, retraining programs, and transparency proved essential.  
> _Insight:_ When people understand how AI affects them, adoption accelerates and resistance decreases.

### 2. **Planet**
Sustainability improved in every case once energy data was surfaced and made measurable.  
> _Insight:_ AI energy use is invisible until monitored — what gets measured gets optimized.

### 3. **Profit**
Long-term ROI correlated directly with responsible governance.  
> _Insight:_ Ethical and environmental stewardship strengthen, not weaken, business performance.
