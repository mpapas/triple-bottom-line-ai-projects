# Case Study: AI-Powered Call Center Transformation

**Project Title:** Call Center AI Modernization  
**Duration:** 9 months  
**Objective:** Offload 80% of inbound call volume (~70,000 daily calls) to AI-driven virtual agents, improving customer experience and reducing cost.

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

A global airline sought to modernize its call center operations using conversational AI agents built on **Azure AI Foundry**.  
The solution handled real-time voice and chat interactions across multiple languages and integrated with booking, loyalty, and baggage APIs.

**Stakeholders:**  
- Chief Customer Officer (Sponsor)  
- Operations & IT Support Teams  
- Vendor: Azure + Conversational AI Partner  
- Call Center Workforce (800 agents)  

**Constraints:**  
- Must maintain customer satisfaction ≥ 90%  
- Support 24/7 global coverage  
- Must comply with GDPR and data localization laws

## ⚖️ Pre-Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Description | TBL Dimension |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Employee Anxiety | Fear of layoffs due to automation. | People |
| Energy Footprint | Real-time inference required high GPU utilization. | Planet |
| Bias Risk | Language model trained primarily on English transcripts. | People |
| Cost Pressure | CFO expected 30% cost reduction in Year 1. | Profit |
| Customer Trust | Concerns about data privacy and synthetic voice disclosure. | People / Governance |

## 🧩 Initial TBL Scorecard

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **People** | Workforce well-being & fairness | Low | -1 | Anxiety and limited retraining programs |
| **Planet** | Energy efficiency & carbon usage | Medium | -1 | High compute intensity |
| **Profit** | Cost savings & scalability | High | +2 | Clear financial benefit |

**Composite Score:** **0.0 (Neutral)** — financially strong but ethically fragile.

## 🌍 TBL-Driven Interventions

| Intervention | Dimension | Impact | Effort | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **1. Human-in-the-Loop escalation** | People | +1 | Medium | Ensures critical calls (medical, cancellations) routed to humans. |
| **2. Agent reskilling & redeployment program** | People | +1.5 | High | Retrains agents for supervisory or analytics roles. |
| **3. Model compression & caching** | Planet | +1 | Medium | Reduced GPU energy use by ~25%. |
| **4. Fairness re-training on multilingual datasets** | People | +0.5 | High | Improved accuracy for non-English speakers. |
| **5. Transparent disclosure & voice branding policy** | Governance / People | +0.5 | Low | Builds customer trust in AI interactions. |

## 📈 Updated TBL Scorecard (Post-Intervention)

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Change |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **People** | Workforce transition, fairness, transparency | High | +1.5 | ▲ +2.5 |
| **Planet** | Efficient inference, greener hosting | High | +0.5 | ▲ +1.5 |
| **Profit** | Sustained cost savings, fewer escalations | High | +2 | — |

**New Composite Score:** **+1.3 (Strong Positive Balance)**

## 🧮 Key Insights for Project Managers

1. **Automation doesn’t replace people — it redefines their value.**  
   Workforce redeployment turned potential layoffs into career growth.

2. **Energy efficiency is an invisible KPI.**  
   Model compression and region selection materially reduced carbon impact.

3. **Transparency builds trust faster than speed.**  
   Customers appreciated knowing they were talking to an AI — satisfaction rose 6%.

4. **RAI + TBL = Durable adoption.**  
   When AI benefits all stakeholders, change resistance fades.

## 📊 Lessons Learned

| Phase | Lesson | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Initiation | Early workforce engagement is key. | Include labor reps in project scoping. |
| Planning | Energy KPIs must be defined early. | Add GPU-hour monitoring to plans. |
| Execution | Disclosure policies prevent PR risk. | Include “synthetic voice” messaging in scripts. |
| Monitoring | Combine operational + ethical dashboards. | Report fairness, latency, and satisfaction together. |
| Closure | Success stories drive cultural change. | Publish internal “AI + Human” outcomes summary. |
