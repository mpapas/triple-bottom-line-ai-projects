# Case Study: Cloud Data Migration to Azure

**Project Title:** Cloud Data Migration (Azure)  
**Duration:** 6 months (with optional 2-week extension scenario)  
**Objective:** Migrate two on-prem data centers to Azure to reduce operational cost by ~20% and modernize analytics.

---

## 🧭 Project Summary

The company aimed to consolidate its on-premise infrastructure into Microsoft Azure, enabling analytics modernization and improved scalability.  
The project combined **lift-and-shift migration** with selective adoption of **Azure PaaS** services (Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Monitor).

**Stakeholders:**  
- CFO (Executive Sponsor)  
- IT Operations (24 staff)  
- Data & Analytics Team  
- External Systems Integrator Vendor  

**Constraints:**  
- Fixed 6-month timeline  
- Change freeze during quarter-end close  
- Sustainability pledge: *Net-zero by 2030*

## ⚖️ Pre-Migration Challenges

| Challenge | Description | TBL Dimension |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Overtime & Burnout Risk | Teams working extended hours under fixed deadline. | People |
| Supply Chain Emissions | Vendor transparency unclear; air freight used for urgent hardware. | Planet |
| Energy Spikes | On-prem hardware required high power during transitional overlap. | Planet |
| Vendor Ethics Unknown | No sustainability clauses in supplier contracts. | Profit / Governance |
| Compliance Fatigue | Staff struggling to keep up with dual data residency rules. | People |

## 🧩 TBL Scorecard (Initial Assessment)

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Baseline Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Notes |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| **People** | Workforce well-being & workload balance | Medium | -1 | High burnout risk due to compressed timeline |
| **Planet** | Energy and carbon impact | Low | -2 | Overlapping infrastructure during migration |
| **Profit** | Cost efficiency & ROI | High | +2 | 20% OPEX reduction forecasted post-migration |

**Average TBL Composite Score:** **-0.3 (Moderate Risk)**  
The project was financially attractive but ethically and environmentally fragile.

## 🌍 TBL-Driven Interventions

| Intervention | Dimension | Impact | Effort | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **1. Extend timeline by 2 weeks** | People / Planet | +1.5 | Low | Reduces burnout and avoids costly air freight. |
| **2. Integrate vendor sustainability clause** | Planet / Profit | +0.5 | Medium | Aligns supply chain with 2030 net-zero goal. |
| **3. Add Azure Sustainability Insights dashboard** | Planet | +1 | Low | Tracks cloud region energy intensity. |
| **4. Use Azure Hybrid Benefit + reserved instances** | Profit | +0.5 | Medium | Lowers long-term compute costs sustainably. |
| **5. Conduct post-migration employee pulse survey** | People | +0.5 | Low | Measures workforce sentiment and retention. |

## 📈 Updated TBL Scorecard (Post-Intervention Scenario)

| Dimension | Key Criteria | Confidence | Score (-2..+2) | Change |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **People** | Reduced burnout, improved morale | High | +1 | ▲ +2 |
| **Planet** | Lower transport emissions, green region hosting | High | +1 | ▲ +3 |
| **Profit** | Slightly delayed ROI but stronger efficiency | High | +1.5 | ▲ -0.5 (short-term trade-off) |

**New Composite Score:** **+1.2 (Positive, Sustainable Trajectory)**

## 🔍 Executive Narrative

> “By extending the migration by just two weeks, the team prevented staff burnout, eliminated the need for air-freighted components, and aligned vendor operations with the company’s 2030 sustainability roadmap.  
> The adjusted plan delivered slightly later but resulted in stronger employee engagement, cleaner energy usage, and a more resilient ROI curve — a model example of how Triple Bottom Line thinking enhances both human and financial performance.”

## 🧮 Key Insights for Project Managers

1. **Short-term pressure can erode long-term sustainability.**  
   The 2-week extension paid dividends across all dimensions.

2. **Suppliers are part of your carbon footprint.**  
   Embedding sustainability clauses early prevents last-minute emissions surprises.

3. **Data migration ≠ sustainability migration.**  
   Lifting workloads to the cloud without tracking region energy profiles misses an opportunity for measurable carbon gains.

4. **TBL trade-offs are data-driven.**  
   PMs can quantify social and environmental benefits just as they track cost and schedule.

## 📊 Lessons Learned (for Repository Template Use)

| Phase | Lesson | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Initiation | Purpose statements must include social/environmental outcomes. | Require TBL framing in every project charter. |
| Planning | Vendor sustainability not default; must be negotiated. | Add sustainability checks to procurement templates. |
| Execution | Workload balance affects success more than tools. | Integrate well-being tracking into project health metrics. |
| Monitoring | Carbon visibility drives better behaviors. | Use Azure Monitor and Sustainability Insights dashboards. |
| Closure | ESG integration completes the feedback loop. | Send metrics to ESG reporting for enterprise-wide tracking. |

## 🧭 PM’s Reflection

> “Responsible AI and cloud migration both begin with intent.  
> The Triple Bottom Line doesn’t slow us down — it shows us how to move forward responsibly.”
