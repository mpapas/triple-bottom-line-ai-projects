# Triple Bottom Line Dimensions

The **Triple Bottom Line (TBL)** is built on three interdependent dimensions: **People**, **Planet**, and **Profit**. Together, they form a holistic lens for project success.

Rather than treating social, environmental, and financial goals as trade-offs, the TBL encourages **synergy and balance** across them. For AI projects — which often impact labor, energy, and equity simultaneously — this multidimensional approach is critical.

## 🧍‍♀️ People — The Human and Social Dimension
Focuses on how AI affects individuals, teams, and communities.

| Sub-Focus | Description | AI Project Example |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Ethical Impact** | Evaluate potential harm or bias in data and decisions. | Ensuring recruitment AI doesn’t disadvantage underrepresented groups. |
| **Workforce Well-Being** | Address job displacement, role changes, and reskilling. | Offering retraining before automation deployment. |
| **Accessibility & Inclusion** | Make systems usable by all demographics. | Designing voice agents with multilingual and accessible interfaces. |

---

## 🌱 Planet — The Environmental Dimension
Evaluates the ecological footprint of AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

| Sub-Focus | Description | AI Project Example |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Energy Efficiency** | Optimize compute and training for energy use. | Selecting smaller or fine-tuned models over large general ones. |
| **Carbon Management** | Monitor emissions from model training and inference. | Tracking cloud energy usage and offsetting emissions. |
| **Resource Circularity** | Encourage hardware reuse, recycling, and cloud right-sizing. | Extending GPU lease cycles or choosing lower-impact regions. |

---

## 💰 Profit — The Economic and Organizational Dimension
Ensures that AI projects create sustainable business value without undermining ethics or the environment.

| Sub-Focus | Description | AI Project Example |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Resilient ROI** | Balance cost savings with ethical and reputational risks. | Calculating ROI with carbon and social cost factors. |
| **Governance & Compliance** | Strengthen trust through transparency and regulation readiness. | Meeting ISO/IEC 42001 or AI Act obligations. |
| **Innovation & Longevity** | Build solutions that scale responsibly over time. | Designing reusable agent frameworks rather than single-use prototypes. |

### PM’s Takeaway
> A successful AI project doesn’t just meet its deadline — it benefits people, protects the planet, and sustains profit over the long term.
