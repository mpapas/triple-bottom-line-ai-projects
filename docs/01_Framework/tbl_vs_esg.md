# Triple Bottom Line vs. ESG

While **TBL (Triple Bottom Line)** and **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** are closely related, they operate at different levels:

| Feature | Triple Bottom Line (TBL) | Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Focus Level** | Project or initiative level | Organizational and investor level |
| **Purpose** | Guide day-to-day project decisions | Enable transparency for investors and regulators |
| **Primary Users** | Project Managers, Delivery Teams | Executives, Boards, Shareholders |
| **Time Horizon** | Operational, short- to medium-term | Strategic, long-term sustainability metrics |
| **Output** | Scorecards, checklists, lessons learned | Sustainability reports, ESG disclosures |

**TBL helps ESG come to life**.  
It gives Project Managers a way to measure the *same dimensions* (People, Planet, Profit) **inside actual AI delivery workflows**.

### Example
| Scenario | ESG Lens | TBL Application |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| A company’s AI-driven logistics platform aims to cut emissions. | ESG reports progress toward net-zero goals. | The PM uses a TBL scorecard to evaluate vendor energy sources, model efficiency, and driver job satisfaction during the rollout. |

### Integration Tip
If your organization already publishes ESG metrics:
- Map **TBL outcomes** (e.g., “reduced model compute by 20%”) to relevant ESG indicators.
- Add a short “TBL summary” section to project closure reports — a micro-level reflection of macro ESG progress.
