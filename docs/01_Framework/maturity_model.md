# Triple Bottom Line Maturity Model for AI Projects

Use this model to assess your organization’s **readiness and maturity** in integrating the Triple Bottom Line into AI delivery.

| Level | Name | Description | Typical PM Behavior |
|--------|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **1** | *Ad Hoc* | No formal sustainability or ethical checks. Focus solely on cost/schedule. | RAI/TBL not mentioned in charters or risks. |
| **2** | *Aware* | Leadership acknowledges ethical and environmental concerns but no process exists. | PMs raise TBL issues reactively. |
| **3** | *Structured* | Some projects include TBL scorecards or bias checks. | PMs voluntarily track non-financial KPIs. |
| **4** | *Integrated* | TBL metrics embedded in governance and dashboards. | Steering committees review TBL progress routinely. |
| **5** | *Optimized* | TBL is part of corporate DNA; data informs ESG reporting. | PMOs benchmark, improve, and publish TBL results. |

1. **Standardize templates** — Adopt the TBL scorecard, risk register, and AI checklist from this toolkit.  
2. **Train teams** — Introduce RAI and TBL awareness in onboarding or project kickoffs.  
3. **Measure and report** — Add TBL KPIs to dashboards.  
4. **Reward improvement** — Recognize projects that balance People, Planet, and Profit outcomes.

### PM’s Takeaway
> Maturity isn’t about perfection — it’s about consistent progress. Every time a project manager logs a fairness risk, tracks energy use, or documents model transparency, your organization moves up the curve.
