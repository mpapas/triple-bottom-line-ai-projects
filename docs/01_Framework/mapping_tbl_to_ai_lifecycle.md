# Mapping the Triple Bottom Line to the AI Project Lifecycle

The Triple Bottom Line becomes actionable when integrated across the **five standard project phases**:
> *Initiation → Planning → Execution → Monitoring & Control → Closure*

Each phase offers unique opportunities to embed TBL thinking.

---

### 1. Initiation — Setting Intent and Scope
**Goal:** Establish purpose and define success beyond ROI.

| Key Actions | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Define “People, Planet, Profit” outcomes in the business case. | Include well-being, carbon, and cost metrics in the project charter. |
| Identify ethical, social, and environmental stakeholders early. | Engage HR, Legal, and Sustainability teams before kickoff. |

---

### 2. Planning — Designing for Responsibility
**Goal:** Translate TBL intent into measurable deliverables.

| Key Actions | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Add bias and sustainability checks to the risk register. | “Energy use exceeds net-zero targets.” |
| Select eco-efficient architecture and regions. | Deploy in low-carbon cloud zones; right-size models. |
| Define KPIs for all three dimensions. | % bias reduction (People), kWh/model (Planet), ROI payback (Profit). |

---

### 3. Execution — Delivering Responsibly
**Goal:** Implement the AI solution with fairness, efficiency, and transparency.

| Key Actions | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Conduct fairness and explainability tests each sprint. | Use Microsoft RAI Dashboard or AI Fairness 360. |
| Monitor model compute and retraining frequency. | Automate usage tracking via Azure Monitor or CloudWatch. |

---

### 4. Monitoring & Control — Ensuring Integrity
**Goal:** Track progress on TBL KPIs and course-correct early.

| Key Actions | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Include TBL KPIs in Steering Committee reports. | “Energy use trending above forecast by +15%.” |
| Update the RAI/TBL risk register quarterly. | Log ethical issues like model drift or bias re-emergence. |

---

### 5. Closure — Learning and Scaling
**Goal:** Capture lessons learned and inform organizational improvement.

| Key Actions | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Publish an AI “System Card” summarizing social, environmental, and business outcomes. | Share model performance, carbon intensity, and fairness results. |
| Archive documentation for future audits and ESG reporting. | Centralize data lineage and decision logs. |

---

### PM’s Takeaway
> Embed TBL checkpoints where you already track schedule, cost, and quality — making sustainability and ethics part of *how you manage*, not what you manage later.
