# Why the Triple Bottom Line Matters in AI

AI offers extraordinary promise — but without thoughtful management, it can also accelerate inequality, energy consumption, and short-term thinking.

The **Triple Bottom Line (People–Planet–Profit)** provides a *balanced framework* for ensuring that AI innovation creates sustainable value across all three dimensions.

### 1. People — Empowerment and Inclusion
AI affects employees, customers, and communities.  
TBL encourages questions such as:
- Does this system enhance or erode human agency?
- Have we evaluated workforce reskilling and job transitions?
- Are users represented fairly in the training data and testing process?

### 2. Planet — Environmental Stewardship
Large-scale AI workloads can drive significant energy demand.  
TBL thinking encourages:
- Measuring model training and inference emissions.
- Using greener cloud regions and efficient architectures.
- Selecting model sizes proportional to the business need.

### 3. Profit — Sustainable Prosperity
AI should generate value that is ethical, resilient, and long-term:
- Are we optimizing for enduring ROI, not just short-term savings?
- Does the AI strengthen brand trust and compliance readiness?
- How does sustainability performance tie into business KPIs?

### The PM’s Role
Project Managers are the **connective tissue** between strategy and execution.  
By integrating TBL into project charters, governance reviews, and closure reports, PMs help organizations:
- Align AI initiatives with ESG goals and ethical frameworks.
- Quantify sustainability and social impacts alongside budget and schedule.
- Build AI systems that *the organization can be proud of* — not just efficient, but responsible.
