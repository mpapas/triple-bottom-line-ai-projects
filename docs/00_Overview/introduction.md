# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how organizations operate, innovate, and make decisions. Yet as its reach expands, so does its responsibility. AI doesn’t just automate tasks — it influences livelihoods, ecosystems, and economies. 

Project Managers sit at the intersection of this transformation. They are uniquely positioned to ensure that **AI projects are delivered not only successfully, but sustainably and ethically**. 

This repository introduces a practical framework — the **Triple Bottom Line (TBL)** — as a foundation for *Responsible AI Project Management*. It offers checklists, scorecards, templates, and real-world examples to help project managers translate abstract values like “fairness,” “sustainability,” and “accountability” into measurable project outcomes.

By integrating the **TBL dimensions of People, Planet, and Profit** into your project lifecycle, you can:
- Deliver AI initiatives that *enhance human well-being* rather than replace it.
- Reduce environmental impact by optimizing compute, data storage, and deployment choices.
- Achieve long-term business resilience and stakeholder trust.

The Triple Bottom Line is not an add-on. It’s how tomorrow’s successful AI projects will be managed today.
