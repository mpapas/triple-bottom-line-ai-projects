# What Is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?

The **Triple Bottom Line (TBL)** is a framework that expands the definition of success beyond profit to include **People** and **Planet**.  
It was first popularized by John Elkington in the 1990s as a way to measure the *true* cost and value of organizational performance.

| Dimension | Focus | Example Questions for AI Projects |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| **People** | Human and social impact | Who benefits or may be harmed by this AI system? Does it support fair labor, accessibility, and equity? |
| **Planet** | Environmental stewardship | How much energy does this model consume? Can we optimize data center usage or use renewable hosting? |
| **Profit** | Economic and organizational resilience | Are cost savings achieved sustainably? Does automation create long-term value and trust? |

### Why It Matters for AI
AI projects amplify both benefits and risks. The TBL ensures that **efficiency gains in one area do not cause unintended harm in another** — for instance, saving costs through automation while overlooking workforce wellbeing or the carbon footprint of compute.

By applying the TBL lens, Project Managers make better trade-offs, manage risks more holistically, and align AI investments with the organization’s long-term purpose.
