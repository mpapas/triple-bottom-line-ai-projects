# 🧰 Tools Overview — Triple Bottom Line (TBL) & Responsible AI Toolkit

This section provides practical tools to help **Project Managers** integrate **Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet, Profit)** and **Responsible AI (RAI)** principles directly into project delivery.  
Each tool can be used independently, but together they form a complete workflow — from project initiation through closure and continuous improvement.

## ⚙️ 1. Responsible AI Project Manager’s Checklist

**File:** [Responsible_AI_PM_Checklist.xlsx](Responsible_AI_PM_Checklist.xlsx)

A structured checklist aligned to the five project phases (Initiation → Closure).  
It helps PMs verify that responsible and sustainable practices are built into each step of the project lifecycle.

| Phase | Sample Actions |
|--------|----------------|
| **Initiation** | Confirm project aligns with your organization’s Responsible AI policy. |
| **Planning** | Add bias, sustainability, and fairness to the risk register. |
| **Execution** | Apply fairness testing tools and track energy consumption. |
| **Monitoring** | Review RAI KPIs in steering committee meetings. |
| **Closure** | Publish an AI System Card and capture lessons learned. |

> 🧩 **Use when:** starting or auditing any AI project to ensure no ethical or sustainability step is missed.

## 📊 2. TBL Scorecard Template

**File:** [TBL_Scorecard_Template.xlsx](TBL_Scorecard_Template.xlsx)

Quantifies the balance between **People, Planet, and Profit**.  
Allows PMs to assign numeric scores (−2 to +2) and confidence levels to each dimension and visualize progress over time.

| Dimension | Example Metric | Scoring Tip |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **People** | Employee well-being, diversity, or inclusion score | +2 = Positive, −2 = Negative impact |
| **Planet** | Energy efficiency, carbon footprint, resource use | Focus on efficiency per workload |
| **Profit** | ROI, resilience, innovation sustainability | Include long-term vs short-term benefits |

> 🧩 **Use when:** you want to evaluate trade-offs and show stakeholders a balanced project impact.

> **NOTE** you can use a custom GPT to help kickstart the scoring and to experiment with the different dimensions. The custom GPT is located here:

## 🪜 3. TBL Risk Register Template

**File:** [TBL_Risk_Register_Template.xlsx](TBL_Risk_Register_Template.xlsx)

Integrates TBL risk factors into your traditional project risk register.  
Tracks ethical, social, environmental, and governance-related risks alongside financial and technical ones.

| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Risk** | Description of the risk (e.g., “Bias in model predictions”). |
| **Dimension** | TBL category affected (People / Planet / Profit). |
| **Likelihood × Impact** | Quantitative exposure calculation. |
| **Mitigation Plan** | Preventive or corrective action. |

> 🧩 **Use when:** assessing or reporting project risks that extend beyond schedule and budget.

---

## 👥 4. Stakeholder Map Template

**File:** [stakeholder_map_template.md](stakeholder_map_template.md)

Maps the influence, interest, and TBL concerns of key stakeholders.  
Helps identify underrepresented voices (e.g., sustainability teams, ethics committees, affected communities).

| Stakeholder | Role | Influence | Interest | TBL/RAI Concerns |
|--------------|------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Legal | Compliance | High | Medium | Privacy, AI Act |
| HR | Workforce | Medium | High | Reskilling, fairness |

> 🧩 **Use when:** conducting stakeholder analysis or preparing for governance boards.

---

## 🌱 5. Sustainability Metrics Guide

**File:** [sustainability_metrics.md](sustainability_metrics.md)

Outlines common environmental performance metrics for AI systems and data infrastructure.  
Enables teams to track sustainability KPIs as easily as financial KPIs.

| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Energy (kWh)** | Power consumption per 1,000 training or inference operations. |
| **Carbon Intensity (gCO₂e)** | Emissions associated with compute energy. |
| **Hardware Utilization (%)** | Indicates under/over-provisioning efficiency. |
| **Cloud Region Mix** | Helps choose lower-carbon hosting locations. |

> 🧩 **Use when:** reporting energy or carbon efficiency in sustainability or ESG scorecards.

## 🧠 6. Responsible AI Phase Questions

**File:** [Responsible_AI_PM_Questions.md](Responsible_AI_PM_Questions.md)

A phase-by-phase list of reflection questions for embedding Responsible AI considerations throughout your project lifecycle.

| Phase | Sample Question |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Initiation** | What human or societal problem are we solving? |
| **Planning** | Have we identified privacy and sustainability risks? |
| **Execution** | Are fairness and safety tests integrated into QA? |
| **Monitoring** | Are RAI KPIs reviewed in governance forums? |
| **Closure** | Did we achieve outcomes without unintended harm? |

> 🧩 **Use when:** facilitating team discussions, risk workshops, or retrospectives.
