# Responsible AI Questions for Project Managers

## Initiation Phase
- What human or societal problem are we solving?
- Who could be harmed if this AI behaves incorrectly?
- Have we defined success beyond financial ROI?

## Planning Phase
- Does our data represent the diversity of users impacted?
- Have we identified privacy, security, and sustainability risks?
- Whatâ€™s our plan for human oversight and model interpretability?

## Execution Phase
- Are RAI validation steps (bias, explainability, safety) in our sprints or test plans?
- Do team members know how to escalate ethical concerns?
- Are we measuring environmental impact?

## Monitoring & Controlling Phase
- Are RAI KPIs tracked like cost or schedule?
- Is there a governance body reviewing AI model changes?
- Are stakeholder concerns addressed transparently?

## Closure Phase
- Did the system deliver benefits without unintended harm?
- What RAI lessons should be standardized across future projects?
- Is post-deployment monitoring in place?
